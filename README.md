# Jenjinn chess engine
watch this space...

This project has taught me a great deal of things, maybe the most important is the value of unit tests and using a TDD approach. There is a paralysing lack of automated tests, especially for the search and evaluation parts of the engine. This is preventing me from refactoring with any sort of confidence a few months after I finished this version. 

At this point I am undecided as to whether to write unit tests for this project, rewrite the engine properly in C++ or just leave it for the forseeable future.
